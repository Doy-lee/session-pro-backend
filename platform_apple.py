    # NOTE: Apple provides multiple IDs for the transaction that are guaranteed to be
    # unique. They all have different purposes with different lifetimes.
    #
    #   transactionId
    #     The App Store generates a new value for transaction identifier every time the
    #     subscription automatically renews or the user restores it on a new device.
    #
    #     When a user first purchases a subscription, the transaction identifier always
    #     matches the original transaction identifier (originalTransactionId). For a restore
    #     or renewal, the transaction identifier doesnâ€™t match the original transaction
    #     identifier. If a user restores or renews the same subscription multiple times,
    #     each restore or renewal has a unique transaction identifier.
    #
    #   originalTransactionId
    #     This value is identical to the transaction identifier (transactionId) except when
    #     the user restores or renews a subscription.
    #
    #     This field uniquely identifies a subscription, rather than a single subscription
    #     renewal purchase. Across any number of subscription renewals, billing retry and
    #     grace periods, and periods where the user unsubscribed, this value will remain
    #     constant for a given user and subscription product pairing.
    #
    #   webOrderLineItemId
    #     The unique identifier of subscription purchase events across devices, including
    #     subscription renewals.
    #
    #     It is an identifier of a completed subscription renewal purchase. For an
    #     auto-renewing monthly subscription, a purchase is made once per month to renew the
    #     subscription. Each monthly purchase will have its own webOrderLineItemId. Even if
    #     the user accesses their subscription from multiple devices or restores purchases,
    #     this webOrderLineItemId is the same, since it's tied to their month's purchase of
    #     the subscription entitlement.

    # In order to cover all the possible cases, we preserve all the transaction IDs into the
    # backend so that we can handle all the different scenarios Apple can notify us with because
    # their notifications about the same semantic subscription might only have 1 or more of these
    # IDs in commonality.

    # NOTE: There's only one v2 notfication sent per event triggered by the user. For example an
    # upgrade of a subscription is implemented by refunding the pro-rata amount followed by
    # upgrading the subscription. One event is issued for this, a DID_CHANGE_RENEWL_PREF with an
    # UPGRADE subtype instead of 2 notifications i.e.: 1 refund and 1 upgrade notification.
